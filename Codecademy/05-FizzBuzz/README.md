# FIZZBUZZ

[FizzBuzz](https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges/code-challenge-fizzbuzz-javascript)

Write a ```fizzbuzz()``` function that takes in a number, ```n```, and returns an array of the numbers from ```1``` to n. For multiples of three, use ```"Fizz"``` instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, use ```"Buzz"```. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, use ```"FizzBuzz"``` (capitalization matters).

For example, ```fizzbuzz(16)``` should return ```[1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz', 16]```.

This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with many top companies, including Google. If youâ€™ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-javascript) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

```Javascript
function fizzbuzz(n) {
  // Write your code here
}

console.log(fizzbuzz(16));

// Leave this line for testing:
module.exports = fizzbuzz;
```
