# REVERSE WORDS

Reverse Words
Write a ```wordReverser()``` function that will take a given string and reverse the order of the words. You may assume that the string is a sentence that contains only letters and spaces, with all words separated by one space.

For example, ```wordReverser("Codecademy rules")``` should return ```"rules Codecademy"``` and ```wordReverser("May the Fourth be with you")``` should return "you with be Fourth the May".

This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with many top companies, including Google. If youâ€™ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-javascript) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

```Javascript
function wordReverser(phrase) {
  // Write your code here
}

console.log(wordReverser("Codecademy rules"));

// Leave this so we can test your code:
module.exports = wordReverser;
```
