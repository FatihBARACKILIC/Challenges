# UNIQUE CHARACTERS IN A STRING

[Unique Characters in a String](https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges/code-challenge-unique-characters-in-a-string-javascript)
Write a ```uniqueCharacters()``` function that determines if any given string has all unique characters (i.e. no character in the string is duplicated). If the string has all unique characters, the function should return ```true```. If the string does not have all unique characters, return ```false```.

For example, ```uniqueCharacters("apple")``` should return ```false```.

This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with Google and Amazon. If youâ€™ve covered the material in Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge.

Note that if the function is called with an empty string (```""```), the program should return an error message.

```Javascript
function uniqueCharacters(stringIn) {


}

// Leave this so we can test your code:
module.exports = uniqueCharacters;
```
