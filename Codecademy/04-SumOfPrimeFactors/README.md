# SUM OF PRIME FACTORS

[Sum of Prime Factors](https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges/code-challenge-sum-of-prime-factors-javascript)
Create a ```sumOfPrimeFactors()``` function that takes in an integer ```n``` and returns the sum of all of its prime factors. As a reminder, a prime number is a number whose only factors are one and itself. Therefore, a prime factor is a factor of a given number that itself is a prime number.

For example, ```sumOfPrimeFactors(91)``` should return ```20``` since its prime factors are 13 and 7.

This challenge and variations of it were reported to have been asked at interviews with Google.

If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

```Javascript
function sumOfPrimeFactors(n) {
  
}


// Leave this so we can test your code:
module.exports = sumOfPrimeFactors;
```
