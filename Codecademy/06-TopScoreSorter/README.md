# TOP SCORE SORTER

[Top Score Sorter](https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges/code-challenge-top-score-sorter-javascript)
Write a ```scoreSorter()``` function that will take a list of unsorted scores along with the highest possible score. It should return a sorted list of all of the scores, in descending order from high to low. You are expected to create and implement your own sorting algorithm for this challenge.

For example, ```scoreSorter([1, 2, 3, 9999, 13], 10000)``` should return ```[9999, 13, 3, 2, 1]```.

This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with many top companies, including Google. If youâ€™ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-javascript) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

```Javascript
function scoreSorter(array, topScore) {
  // Write your code here
}

console.log(scoreSorter([1, 2, 3, 9999, 13], 10000))
// Leave this so we can test your code:
module.exports = scoreSorter;

```
