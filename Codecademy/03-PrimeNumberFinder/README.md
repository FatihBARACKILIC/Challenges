# PRIME NUMBER FINDER

[Prime Number Finder](https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges/code-challenge-prime-number-finder-javascript)
Create a ```primeFinder()``` function that takes in a number, ```n```, and returns all the prime numbers from ```1``` to ```n``` (inclusive). As a reminder, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by ```1``` and itself.

For example, ```primeFinder(11)``` should return ```[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]```.

Variations of this challenge have been reported to have been asked at interviews with Facebook. If you’ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-javascript) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

```Javascript
function primeFinder(n) {
  // Write your code here
}

console.log(primeFinder(11))

// Leave this so we can test your code:
module.exports = primeFinder;
```
